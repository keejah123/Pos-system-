 POS System

This is a simple **Point of Sale (POS)** system built using **Python**.  
It allows you to manage products, add items to a cart, and print receipts.

 Features

- Add new products (name, price)
- View available products
- Add products to cart
- Checkout and calculate total
- Generate and save receipts

 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (comes built-in with Python)


Project Structure

```
pos.py     # Main POS system file
```

(Everything is inside `pos.py` â€” simple and clean!)

 Notes

- All transactions are saved in an SQLite database (`pos_system.db`).
- Receipts are automatically generated after each successful sale.
